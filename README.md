# cyber-carpentry-slides-2019
This repo contains the slides and presentation materials for the 2019 cyber carpentry workshop. I've also added some resources for best practices in scientific computing.

## resources for best practices

The two articles below are **my favorite resources**. I would also look at the articles they cite, there are several links to further guides on data management and organization.

- [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510): this article has examples for how to set up your code and results folder structures. It is more of a 'where do I start' in setting up a project.
- [Best practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745): This article is geared towards onging computational projects. 
  
The articles below are further resources on organizing analyses and projects. 
  
- [Reproducibility using continuous analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3780): this article is kind of like the 'next level' after applying the good enough and best practices. This allows for your analysis to work continuously anytime the source code or data changes and is great for sharing analyses and reproducibility.
- [Organizing a data science project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-sciencee): this article is geared more towards data science projects, but also suggests how to organize a project
